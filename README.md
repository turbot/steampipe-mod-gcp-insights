## Overview

Dashboards can help answer questions like:

- How many resources do I have?
- How old are my resources?
- Are there any publicly accessible resources?
- Is encryption enabled and what keys are used for encryption?
- Is versioning enabled?
- What are the relationships between closely connected resources like network subnets, routers, associated DNS policies, and instances?

Dashboards are available for Compute, IAM, KMS, Kubernetes and Storage services.
