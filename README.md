# GCP Insights Mod for Powerpipe

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-gcp-insights/main/docs/images/gcp_compute_instance_dashboard.png)

## Overview

Dashboards can help answer questions like:

- How many resources do I have?
- How old are my resources?
- Are there any publicly accessible resources?
- Is encryption enabled and what keys are used for encryption?
- Is versioning enabled?
- What are the relationships between closely connected resources like network subnets, routers, associated DNS policies, and instances?

Dashboards are available for 10+ services, including Compute, IAM, KMS, Kubernetes, Storage, and more!

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Powerpipe (https://powerpipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/powerpipe
```

This mod also requires [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) with the [GCP plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/gcp) as the data source. Install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads), or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/steampipe
steampipe plugin install gcp
```

Steampipe will automatically use your default GCP credentials. Optionally, you can [setup multiple projects](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/gcp#multi-project-connections).

Finally, install the mod:

```sh
mkdir dashboards
cd dashboards
powerpipe mod init
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-gcp-insights
```

### Browsing Dashboards

Start Steampipe as the data source:

```sh
steampipe service start
```

Start the dashboard server:

```sh
powerpipe server
```

Browse and view your dashboards at **http://localhost:9033**.
